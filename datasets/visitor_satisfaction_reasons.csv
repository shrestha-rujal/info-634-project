GEN24_1061067,We moved to NZ in 2021 with the intention of living there permanently.  We were so disgusted with the treatment of the people not taking the toxic vaccine that we decided to come back to the UK.  I am a Brit but my husband is a Kiwi.  He was appalled at the apartheid adopted by the people and their toxic Government.  Although this was a global issue if the Kiwis just looked at the overseas data they could have avoided a lot of the problems they had.  They are too indoctrinated to look at anything outside of NZ.  Disgusting behaviour in my view.  We only came back to NZ to collect the rest of our belongings.  The people are still blinkered.
